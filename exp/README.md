## exp for vocabulary prediction

`exp1.py1` and `exp1-numrecc.py` are used for long-term prediction. A threshold `num_reccom`, which represents the number of words to recommend and filters users who have searched at least `num_reccom` in the following 4 months, is set. The script `exp1-numrecc.py` varys the value of `num_reccom`. Empirical results are located in [folder](https://github.com/lteu/soujian/tree/master/log/long%20term).
